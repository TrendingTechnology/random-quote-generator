## About the project

This is one the freeCodeCamp Front-End Libraries projects.

The requirement is to create a `Random Quote Generator` in React that queries a
third-party API for quotes. The quote then needs to be displayed in the browser and there
needs to be a `share on twitter` button that allows someone to share the quote as a tweet
on Twitter.

### This project was built using the following:

- React
- Material-UI

### The following packages and services are also used in the project:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- TravisCI
- LogRocket
- Sentry.io

The project is hosted on `netlify`.

### Getting the project running locally

The following steps needs to be taken to run the project locally on your system.

You will require `node.js` to be already installed on your system. Using any version above
`9.x` should be fine.

You need to clone the project to your system and then change directory to be in the
project folder.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Asjas/random-quote-generator.git

cd random-quote-generator
```

The `npm packages` can then be installed and the project can be started.

```sh
npm i
npm run start
```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:3000` that you can open in your web
browser.
